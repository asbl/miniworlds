# Drawing with Miniworlds â€“ Basics

## Foreword

This tutorial is heavily inspired by the fantastic lecture notes by Prof. Dr. Michael Kipp: [https://michaelkipp.de/processing/](https://michaelkipp.de/processing/), which are based on Processing.

The Miniworlds version of Processing borrows several ideas and concepts but implements them in slightly different ways.
In this tutorial, youâ€™ll learn programming with Miniworlds using its *Processing mode*, which is modeled after the popular visual programming environment.

## How Does Drawing Work on a Computer?

Monitors consist of a grid of tiny squares. These are so small they appear as points to us. These tiny squares are called *pixels*.

Pixels are arranged in a *coordinate system*, which usually starts in the **top-left corner**:

```{note}
Computer scientists usually start counting at 0.  
That means the top-left corner is (0, 0), and if the screen is 800Ã—600 pixels, the bottom-right corner is (799, 599).
```

## The First Program

A Miniworlds program typically consists of the following parts:

```python
from miniworlds import *
world = World()

# Your code here

world.run()
```

* **Line 1**: Imports the Miniworlds library
* **Line 2**: Creates the game world
* **Last line**: Starts the main loop with `world.run()` â€“ this must always be the final line of your program

Everything in between can be your own code or comments.
Comments start with `#` and are ignored by the computer. They are written for **humans** to help understand the code.

Example:

```python
from miniworlds import *

world = World()

Point((10, 10))

world.run()
```

<img src="../_images/processing/pixel.png" alt="A pixel" width="260px">

You can also set the window size by passing width and height to `World`:

```python
from miniworlds import *

world = World(200, 400)
world.run()
```

## Drawing Basic Shapes

### Lines

Syntax:

```python
Line(startpoint, endpoint)
```

Both `startpoint` and `endpoint` are tuples, e.g., `(1, 2)`.

Draw a line from (10, 10) to (100, 200):

```python
from miniworlds import *

world = World()
Line((10, 10), (100, 200))
world.run()
```

---

### Circles

```python
Circle(position, radius)
```

```{note}
The position refers to the **center** of the circle.
```

Example:

```python
from miniworlds import *

world = World()
Circle((100, 200), 20)
world.run()
```

![A circle](../_images/processing/circle.png)

---

### Rectangles

```python
Rectangle(position, width, height)
```

* `position` is the **center** corner of the rectangle

Example:

```python
from miniworlds import *

world = World()
Rectangle((100, 100), 20, 100)
world.run()
```

![A rectangle](../_images/processing/rectangle.png)

It is often easier to draw a rectangle starting from the top-left position. You can do this with the method `from_center`:

```
Rectangle.from_center((100, 100), 20, 100)
```

---

### Ellipses

```python
Ellipse(position, width, height)
```

Like rectangles, but the shape is oval and fits inside the given rectangle.

Example:

```python
from miniworlds import *

world = World()
Ellipse((100, 100), 20, 100)
world.run()
```

### Centered Rectangles and Ellipses

#### 1. `from_center`

Use `.from_center()` to draw an ellipse centered on a point:

```python
from miniworlds import *

world = World()
Ellipse.from_center((50, 100), 100, 200)
world.run()
```

<img src="../_images/processing/from_center.png" alt="from_center Method" width="260px"/>

#### 2. Using `.center`

You can manually center an ellipse like this:

```python
from miniworlds import *

world = World()
ellipse = Ellipse((0, 0), 100, 200)
ellipse.center = (50, 100)
world.run()
```

## More Complex Shapes

### Arcs

```python
Arc(position, width, height, start_angle, end_angle)
```

* `position`: center of bounding box
* `width` and `height`: ellipse size
* `start_angle`, `end_angle`: angles in degrees, counterclockwise from the right

<img src="../_images/processing/arc.png" alt="Arc - Start and Endangle" width="260px"/>

Example:

```python
from miniworlds import *

world = World()
Arc.from_center((200, 200), 200, 200, 30, 242)
world.run()
```

---

### Triangle

```python
Triangle(p1, p2, p3)
```

Each point is a tuple like `(x, y)`.

Example:

```python
from miniworlds import *

world = World()
Triangle((10, 10), (100, 100), (200, 10))
world.run()
```

---

### Polygon

```python
Polygon(pointlist)
```

`pointlist` is a list of tuples.
For example, a triangle as a polygon:

```python
from miniworlds import *

world = World()
Polygon([(10, 10), (100, 100), (200, 10)])
world.run()
```
